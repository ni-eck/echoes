SLIDE 1
Behold the rolling hills of Iberia, where I first took command of the Carthaginian army. I gazed on the mighty foe — the modest-but-ambitious power of Rome — and I vowed: I will bring the fight to Italy, not wait and cower. Thus we marched north, across the Rhône, into a land of Gauls and mountains.

The Rhône stood before us like a watery threshold; behind, the safety of Spain; ahead, the heart of Rome’s backyard. I ordered rafts and boats built, horses swum across the current, even our elephants coaxed over with care. The Gauls on the far bank jeered — but in one bold stroke, we were on the western bank of the Alps’ foothills.

Then the mountain jaws opened. We marched into ice-winds, up jagged switchbacks where our food froze and our breath became frost. The route was uncertain — no well-trodden path, no friendly guides for some stretches. Some historians still argue which pass we used. But I knew this: I must surprise Rome. So we climbed.
